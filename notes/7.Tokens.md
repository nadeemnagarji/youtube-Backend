What are refresh tokens and access tokens 

refresh token is longlived so whenever a userlogs in the server gives it a refresh token and that token is used for authentication everytime user is 

the refresh token is longlived and accesstoken is shortlived 

both refresh and access token are given to user through cookies 


when user does login first the user is checked in the data base with username or email
then the user object which is returned us by the database we check if its password mathches with the password we got from frontend 

if the password mathes we generate the access and refresh token for that we made a combined method called generateAccessAndRefreshToken and inside this we generate accesstoken and refresh token and also pass the generatedRefreshToken to the user t be save in data base and return this both tokens back 

so once we recieve the access and refresh token from the method we then again make a database qurey to get a userobject which we want to pass to the frontend but we only get the userdata excluding password and refreshtoken

now finally we pass this both tokens in cookies and the userobject in json and return to the frontend


/** NOW LOGOUT **/

to logout user we need to verify that we are loging out the correct user for that we need to verify that the logout request coming from is a valid user to verify that we take the refreshToken of user from the cookies and destructure the token to get user id 
and using that user id we look for the user in the database if the user exists we logout that user 


to do this we design a middleware which does the following
1} take the token from the request body 
2} verify token and extract the userdata from the token
3}using the id from the token call the user from backend and pass this user to next i.e. to the controller of logout route

Now inside logout controller function we have access to the user object using that we again make a databse query using the id from the user and 
 using that id we change the refresh token to null or undefined and then 
 return the response with clearing cookies
