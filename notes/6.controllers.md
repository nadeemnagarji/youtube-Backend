after the project is setup we start writting controllers and their logic 
first we make the register route to make that what we do is we make route called user.routes.js inside that we create a router
using express and we create a route 

router.post("/register",registerUser)


and we export this route and add it in app.js as userRouter  and inside that app.js we add this as a midleware in app as 

app.use("/users",userRouter)


also the user sends us the files such as avatar and to handle this file uploads we make use of multers middleware which we created in utils i.e.e we import the upload from util

we add this upload to the register route so that any file which are uploaded by user can be handled by this upload of multer

soo we add this upload functionality just before the controller as follows

router.route("/register").post(
    upload.fields([
        {
            name:"avatar",
            maxCount:1
        },
        {
            name:"coverImage",
            maxCount:1
        }
    ]),
    registerUser
)

here in post we generally add the controller but since it is a route handling file uploads we added a upload functionality of multer as well  which takes various feilds as an array 
and each feild is an object which has a specific name which mathes with the frontend and maxCount value


then we add the controller funtionality i..e registerUser

for registerUser controller we have to check for following things and do that step by step 
the steps are written in user.controller.js
