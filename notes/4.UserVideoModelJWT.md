1} we write user model and video model schemas  then we do as follows 
2} irst we  install mongoose-aggregate-paginate-v2


use of this library 

Aggregate Functions: MongoDB offers the aggregation framework, which allows you to perform complex data processing tasks and return computed results. Aggregation operations can include grouping, sorting, filtering, and performing computations on data.

Pagination: Pagination is a common practice in web development where large datasets are divided into smaller, manageable chunks called pages. This is particularly useful when displaying data in a user interface, as it improves performance and user experience by loading data incrementally.

mongoose-aggregate-paginate-v2 essentially combines these functionalities. It extends Mongoose's aggregate functionality to support pagination. It allows you to perform aggregation operations on MongoDB collections and paginate the results.

3} then we install bcrypt library for encryption of passwords and jwt tokens for providing access and refresh tokens

i.e.e npm i bcrpyt jsonwebtoken

now after installing this bcrypt and jsonwebtoken we have to add that functionailty 

so where to add?

so we should encrypt the password as soon as user provides us with it and then store it in the database so we have to write the functionality in the user.model.js that too using mongoose hooks which is nothing but a middleware which mongoose provides us with so that we can perform certain tasks before it is saved in data base 

so with the help of this hooks we encrypt our password and save it in database for e.g.

so below we have defined a middlware which does something before the data is saved and the functionality is done in the callback function written inside it 
NOTE==>>
1} the callback function is written as a normal function and not as a arrow function because arrow function does not have the access to the context i.e. this of the event so to provide the context to the function we must write it as a normal function.

2} and that function takes some time to encrypt so we have to make it async and that function has access to the next because it is a middleware

userSchema.pre("save", async function(next){
    this
    
})

4} after writing the middleware for encryption of password we also need to define a method to verify if the password matches with the encrypted password for when user does login to the account we need a method to verify if the passsword matches with the password in the database to do that we make following method

userSchema.methods.isPasswordCorrect = async function(password){
    return await bcrypt.compare(password,this.password)
}

here it will return true if the given password matches the encrypted password and viceversa



/***************************************************************************************/
5} WHAT IS JWT AND configuration of tokens in the database 

so we make some extra methods  for generating access and Refresh token for every user logins namely
1}generateAccessToken = less expiry ==> not stored in database
2}generateRefreshToken = long expiry => stored in database

userSchema.methods.generateAccessToken = function(){
    return jwt.sign(
        {
        _id:this._id,
        email:this.email,
        username:this.username,
        fullName:this.fullName
    }, process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET,
    {
        expiresIn: process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY
    })
}


the jwt.sign() takes many arguments such as  
                    1] payload(info/dataofuser) 2]tokenSecretkey 3]expiry


userSchema.methods.generateRefreshToken = function(){
    return jwt.sign(
        {
            _id: this._id, //payload
            
        },
        process.env.REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET, //tokenSecretKey
        {
            expiresIn: process.env.REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY //Expiry
        }
    )
}
