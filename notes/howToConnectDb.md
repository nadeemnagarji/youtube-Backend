how to connect database professionally 

THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND WHILE USING DATABASES OR INERACTING WITH DATABASES

1} whenever we try to access the data base there will always a possiblity that we can get an error while connecting so its better to wrap that code in try catch or promises to handle errors carefully 

2} DATA BASE IS ALWAYS IN ANOTHER CONTINENT ==> so it takes time to connect or talk with database while putting or getting or updating data so its better to use async await i.e. async wat of coding while interacting with databse 


so to conclude always use async await and try catch when interacting with database
