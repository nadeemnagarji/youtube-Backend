Handling file uploads in backend
The standard of handling files uploads is that they are not stored in the main server of backend rather they are stored on other server or by using other services such as AWS and cloudinary and a link of the files is provided by these services which can be stored in the backend database

so file ==> server ==> aws/cloudinary ==>link==>server==>database

to handle file uploads we make a separate utility and the logic related to that is written in that utility such as cloudinary.js

to make this utility /upload handling we make use of followuing services
1}cloudinary == to store the images /videos
2}multer ==> a nodejs middleware for handling file uploads

so the cloudinary utility /function to handleuplaod is as follows
first we import {v2 as cloudinary} from cloudinary
and import fs from "fs"

then we set configs of cloudinary

cloudinary.config({
cloud_name: process.env.CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME,
api_key: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY,
api_secret: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
});

then we make the function for handling upload which we follow following steps i.e. first we make the user to uplaoad file on our server and the upload it on cloudinary

with the help of multer we take the file from user to our server
and then take that file and upload it on cloudinary and delete from the server i.e. unlink

so the logic for uplaoding the file from server to cloudinary is written in this utility

const uploadOnCloudinary = async (localFilePath) => {
try {
if (!localFilePath) return null
//upload the file on cloudinary
const response = await cloudinary.uploader.upload(localFilePath, {
resource_type: "auto"
})
// file has been uploaded successfull
//console.log("file is uploaded on cloudinary ", response.url);
fs.unlinkSync(localFilePath)
return response;

    } catch (error) {
        fs.unlinkSync(localFilePath) // remove the locally saved temporary file as the upload operation got failed
        return null;
    }

}

this function accepts the filepath as the parameter and it since it is filehandling there are chances of error so we use try catch and its also async since file is uplaoded

now we have created a utility to handle the uploading off file from server to cloudinarty but we also need a function to handle the upload from user to server for this we make a middleware using multer and we inject that middleware in the server to handle file uploads

we name it as {multer.middleware.js}

import multer from "multer";

const storage = multer.diskStorage({
    destination: function (req, file, cb) {
      cb(null, "./public/temp")
    },
    filename: function (req, file, cb) {
      
      cb(null, file.originalname)
    }
  })
  
export const upload = multer({ 
    storage, 
})



// multer has the functionality to use diskstorage or memorystorage here we use diskStorage
// inside that we define a function
